        <input type="text" v-on:input="changeTitle"> 
        v-on directive is like ngModel bind the input value to the output automatically 
        as key pressed. Every key press, function will be invoked and re-renders the vue object and gives the output


        <p><a v-bind:href="link">Google</a></p>
        v-bind is used to bind html attribute to the the property located in data object which is inside Vue object. unlike v-on, v-bind does not use curly braces{{}}
        v-on listens to the function, v-bind binds the property declared in data
        "{{}} we can only use curly braces in the place when we use text" 
        we cant use curly braces in any html element attribute

        <h1 v-once>{{title}}</h1>
        v-once keep the html element as it is in the inital render, so it get render only once, if you reassign the title later and re-render the the html element, v-once keeps it

        Note: Vue.js renders only text not html element
        <p v-html="finishedLink"></p>

        Whatever property you have in the data object, you can update it as you invoke a method and reassign the properties with any value you want

        Everything that is in the computed object can be used as the properties used in data object. Computed object properties are anylized and see if they have a relationship with any other execution so that JS engine will decide whether it should be run or not

        you can type @clcik instead of <v-on:click> or :href instead of <v-bind:href>
